title: My tech stack (2015)
layout: post

I've pieced my rig together quite carefully, creating a rather unique
stack. At the fundamental level it's not so different from a hundred
thousand other hackers' stacks, and thus to comply with the #1 rule of
custom stacks, it demands a dedicated post explaining how cool and
unique it is.

## Laptops

### Thinkpad X200s `kosme`

My most favourite laptop. I've had it since 2011 and it survived quite
a lot; superglued in several spots; some chipped bits have been lost
forever; keyboard replaced (previous one finally fell apart after 3y
of abuse); I've upgraded memory and disk. The CPU is quite slow, but
battery life - still excellent.

Currently running latest [OpenBSD][].

Hardware:

- Intel Core 2 Duo U9300 2x1.20GHz
- 4GB memory
- <strike>Samsung 840 Evo 250GB</strike> back to old 160GB spinning
  plate
- 9 cell battery (used to last 8-9h, but more like 4h these days)

### Thinkpad X250 `luna`

My new laptop. I thought I'd hate the keyboard, but it's acceptable.
I've had to disable the touchpad though - nipple mouse wins 10 out of
10 times.

Currently running [Debian][] stable.

Hardware:

- Intel i5 5300U 4x2.30GHz
- 8GB memory
- Samsung 840 Evo 250GB
- 2x 3 cell batteries

## Working environment: software and setup

I'm a long time (2005ish) [Debian][] user, but more recently (2015),
[OpenBSD][] captured my attention, and subsequently I fell in love.

I keep the portable bits synced between my laptops through a dotfiles
git repository + [GNU Stow][stow].

I do use [`make`](/tech/makefiles.html), `cron` and [`runit`][runit]
extensively, for stuff like shuffling in a new wallpaper every hour,
daily maintenance tasks, or managing random services like `ssh-agent`.

[runit]: http://smarden.org/runit/

### OpenBSD

- Because it's beautiful, stable, well-documented, and simple,
- Because I don't have time for the OS when I need actual work done.
- Because security shouldn't be optional.
- Because Linux is too mainstream :)

[OpenBSD]: https://www.openbsd.org/

### Debian

[Debian][] stable with customisations!

- When I need to run mainstream software, or when something is not
  supported under OpenBSD yet :(
- I stick to current stable releases and use backports & third party
  channels for Firefox, Chromium, etc;
- [No `systemd`](https://ewontfix.com/14/); using `sysvinit`; working
  on a replacement (based on [`runit`][runit]);
- [No `sudo`](/tech/sudo.html); using `su` for interactive console and
  [`sup`](http://git.suckless.org/sup) in scripts;
- [`connman`](https://packages.debian.org/stable/net/connman);

[Debian]: https://www.debian.org/

### Desktop

- I use [`runit`][runit] as my session manager.
- `~/.xsession` runs `runsvdir -P ~/service`; there's a script/service
  for everything a desktop session needs:
    - Window manager: [awesome](https://awesomewm.org/),
      [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/);
    - `xcompmgr`;
    - [`keylaunch`](http://www.oroborus.org/?node=Download) with my
      patches;
    - `mpd`, `transmission-daemon`, etc;
    - A script to run `pkill -HUP -u $USER runsvdir` to exit.
- Everyday apps
    - [`urxvt`](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html), the
      only terminal emulator I've ever seen to do the right thing with
      line wrapping when resizing the window -
      [lite flavour](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/rxvt-unicode-lite);
    - [dmenu](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) with lots of tiny scripts;
    - [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) for all but
      trivial text editing;
    - [Firefox](https://firefox.com/); lots of
      [custom CSS](https://userstyles.org/) to make websites darker;
    - [Rox filer](http://rox.sourceforge.net/desktop/ROX-Filer.html);
    - [`pass`](https://www.passwordstore.org/);
- On the CLI
    - OpenBSD's
      [ksh](http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man1/ksh.1), aka
      [loksh](https://github.com/dimkr/loksh) under Linux;
    - [mosh](https://mosh.org/);
    - Lots of [Makefiles](/tech/makefiles.html);
    - [IPython](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ipython);


## Phone

### Nexus 4 `mako`

Died in an accident in spring 2016.

Used to run [CyanogenMod][]; close to 100% libre (with [F-Droid][]).

I really love and recommend several apps:

- [K-9 Mail](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.fsck.k9)
- [Firefox](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.mozilla.firefox)
- [OsmAnd~](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=net.osmand.plus)
- [AFWall+](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=dev.ukanth.ufirewall)
- [Apollo](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.andrew.apollo)
- [MPDroid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.namelessdev.mpdroid)
- [Tinfoil for *](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=tinfoil)
  series

[F-Droid]: https://f-droid.org/
[CyanogenMod]: http://www.cyanogenmod.org/

A cracked screen has put it out of service. I'm temporarily back to my
invincible [Nokia 2610][]. Quite sure it will survive my next phone as
well.

## Servers

### Dell PowerEdge T20 `glados`

Running FreeBSD 10 - because ZFS, even if insanely complex under the
hood, is friggin' awesome and a breeze to work with.

- Intel Pentium G3220 2x3.00GHz
- 8GB ECC memory
- Stuffed with 4x3TB of spinning plates in RAID-Z; 7.6 TiB usable

Currently employed as a NAS for general file storage (music, movies,
etc), backups, torrents, etc.

### Raspberry Pi v1 model B `dune`

Runs [`unbound`](https://unbound.net/) as a
[local DNS cache](https://calomel.org/unbound_dns.html). Specs:
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b/>.

### Hetzner vServer CX10 `chewie`

The box that powers <https://www.rollc.at/> and the like. Specs:
<https://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produkte_vserver/cx10>.

## Isn't it a lot of wasted electronics and electricity to run such a rig?

I don't think it is. I tend to use and reuse hardware until it breaks,
and repair it if possible, as evidenced by the fact that I'm still
making a 2009 laptop or a 2007 phone do useful things for me.

The environmental impact is something I'm always trying to consider.
Keeping things powered down when unused. Unrepairably broken
electronics end up in recycling. Most of the equipment is very
energy-efficient.
