## Hitch hiking

I was participating in a hitch hiking race, and after a long day and
having made only a few hundred kilometres, my teammates and I were
already a bit down. We step out of a car next to
[a gas station](https://www.google.hr/maps/place/Ina+Zagreb-jug/@45.7748975,15.8767,18z)
on the western part of the ring, only to be welcomed by about a dozen
other participants...

> Welcome to Zagreb! *You won't get out.*

Apparently the guys were already
[stuck there](/2016/05/21/croatia-josipdol.html) for a while.

There's actually an easy way out of that place! It took us just a
moment. Go to the exit, but don't go thumbing there. Instead, notice
there's a door in the fence. Get outside. Walk a few km south. You
want to reach
[the other gas station](https://www.google.hr/maps/place/CRODUX/@45.7453388,15.8801038,18z),
at the other side of the interchange.

You're welcome.

## The Public Transport

The tram network is modern, fast, crowded, and very expensive. Nobody
buys the tickets. It's a fact. The locals are real escape artists when
it comes to encounters with the inspectors. Some popular tricks
include:

- Getting the driver to open the door for you while the tram is
  standing on the traffic lights;

- Pretending to be a foreigner confused by the ticket validation
  machines (which, in fact, actually **are** slightly confusing at
  first);

- Yelling, crying, arguing, or otherwise drama-ing your way out of the
  situation.

I don't know of a single person that actually got fined and paid.

## On a bicycle

Probably one of the most cyclist-unfriendly places in the world.

- You can't go 500m without running into a steep edge. You better get
  off the bike, or at least slow down to climb it. That's on a typical
  bicycle path.

- Many of the paths are barely visible lines, drawn with crappy and
  fading paint on the pedestrian sidewalk. Most are one-way, but some
  are two-way, which is rarely clearly marked and sometimes changes
  randomly on an intersection. The police's top favourite occupation
  is to happily chase cyclists going the wrong way and fine them
  outrageous sums; this happens to no visible improvement in the
  cycling infrastructure.

- Bikes apparently get stolen a lot. You should probably invest at
  least as much in your locking mechanism as you did in the rest of
  the bike; a U-lock is probably the best choice. Also run the lock
  through the frame, not just through the wheel.

That said, once you have that bike thing going, there's a couple of
wonderful places to visit.

## The Parks

The river in Zagreb is a big disappointment, but the major parks all
have some nice ponds. I'm not sure how swimmable they are though.

## The Mountain

In the city where I was born, there is a lower and an upper part, the
division in some spots being a real hill to climb. That's very cool
for a country that's otherwise so flat, it's name literally means
["*a load of flat fields*"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland).

Croatia is relatively flat in the continental part, with the coast
being much more mountainous. Zagreb is situated in these flatlands,
however it has exactly one, fully-blown mountain up there.

The mountain isn't even that big if you'd compare it to
[Tatry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatry), but it still looks down
majestically on the city. It's like the sun or the moon, it's a
landmark that helps you orient yourself if you take one turn too many,
and the view from the top is simply mind-blowing.
