The old website is gone. Welcome the new stuff.

It was a pragmatic choice. I'm a little too busy doing life things to bother
maintaining the code AND the content.

The code was a very cute, but unmaintainable hack. Too much `make`, too much
custom glue, tangled up deployment, too much burden to do a basic post or
update. Meanwhile, 100% of the heavy lifting was done with `pandoc`.

The new stuff is now done with [Jekyll][] on [Github Pages][] ([source][]).
We'll see how long it lasts.

[Github Pages]: https://pages.github.com

The old content was of mixed quality. Maybe it's better to start from scratch.

Hosting on a server costs money and time. I'm OK to yield to my Github
overlords, after all I can always take my static HTML elsewhere.

And now the money can go to a charity instead.

The old stuff is still on
[archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.rollc.at). If you find any of
that old stuff useful, [donate to the archive.org
guys](https://archive.org/donate), they are doing the real work.
