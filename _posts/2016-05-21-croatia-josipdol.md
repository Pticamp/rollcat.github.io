While you're out there hitch hiking, there's nothing else that's both
equally horrible, and at the same time equally highly likely and
frequent, as getting stuck in some nowhere with no practical means of
getting out.

Getting stuck is a part of the adventure. You learn patience and
humility. You learn to find ways out you'd never think of. You
appreciate your own cleverness, or you meet a stranger that becomes
your personal hero. You also learn to *hate* the damn place.
