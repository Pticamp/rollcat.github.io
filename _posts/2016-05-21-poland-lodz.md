- Travelled: 2013-2014

- On [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA)

I normally wouldn't live in a place without some natural bodies of
water: rivers or lakes or sea, such things. Despite that, I've managed
to survive almost two years in Łódź.

It's a big city, however many uninitiated say there's about only a
single interesting place there:
[Piotrkowska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piotrkowska_Street).
That's far from the truth!

## The Parks

[Zdrowie][],
[park Poniatowskiego](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Park+im.+J.+Poniatowskiego,Łódź,+Poland),
or
[Staw Stefańskiego](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Staw+Stefańskiego,+Łódź,+Poland)
are all nice and relaxing places, perfect for a picnic, or (in case of
Staw) even a little swim.

Park Poniatowskiego also has an old bunker complex underneath, the
entrance usually being sealed. Be careful if you go inside!

## The Ruins

There's a lot of old and ruined buildings scattered around the city.
(20th century old, not medieval old.) Most are semi-safe to enter, but
exercise caution.

## The Food

If you find yourself around Piotrkowska, or in Manufaktura, you should
try [Green Way](http://greenway.pl/). Cheap, yummy, and all veg.
Smaller streets branching off Piotrkowska are also full of vegetarian
restaurants.

## The Locals

While Poland is often perceived as xenophobic, you won't have much
trouble communicating in English in Łódź; in fact, you're also likely
to run into other foreigners, visiting or cohabiting.

I was pleasantly surprised to find the locals a very kind and helpful
bunch of people. It's not England, but the difference is noticeable if
you contrast it with the rest of the country.

You'll also find that Łódź has - not entirely a dialect, but say a
distinctive collection of slang words for some common terms; *migawka*
is the monthly public transport pass (standard Polish: *bilet
miesięczny*), or *krańcówka* for the final stop.

## The Public Transport

Some of the country's oldest functioning trams are still occasionally
in service, and that's absolutely not due to the lack of funding (most
of the fleet is actually quite modern) - check out the
[KMST](http://www.kmst.pl/) (*Old Trams Enthusiasts' Club*; also
[old KMST website with info in English](http://www.kmst.mpk.lodz.pl/english/)).

There's also the Europe's longest tram line, 46, which runs all the
way from [Zdrowie][] through
[Zgierz](https://www.google.hr/maps/place/Zgierz,+Poland) to
[Ozorków](https://www.google.hr/maps/place/Ozorków,+Poland). Yep,
that's correct, it actually passes through another city. The trams
running the line are also quite vintage.

The most astonishing thing that I've stumbled upon during my days
there, was that trams would go in a circle on a roundabout. That's in
two
[different](https://www.google.com/maps/place/plac+Wolności,+Łódź,+Poland/)
[locations](https://www.google.com/maps/place/rondo+Lotników+Lwowskich,+Łódź,+Poland)!

Do buy the ticket. It's cheap, every tram has a ticket machine, the
inspectors are a pain, and the fine is high.

## The Underground

No, Łódź doesn't have underground public transport (yet).

Start easy, check out the web page for
[the Sewers Museum "Dętka"](http://www.muzeum-lodz.pl/pl/practical-information)
(scroll down a bit). Go visit! Like it? There's more! But it's pretty
hardcore, and actually not quite legal.

If you're not afraid of dark, confined and smelly places, then equip
yourself with
[*glany*](http://static5.rockmetalshop.pl/pol_pl_glany-STEEL-BLACK-10-dziurek--14797_7.jpg),
a head-mounted lamp, an extra lamp, some
[proper gloves](http://mar-cor.pl/63-113-thickbox/rekawice-ochronne-rwiney.jpg),
and get ready for *the real shit* - literally.

You can always go through a manhole, however it's difficult to find
one that leads directly to a bigger corridor. It's easier to just find
a proper entrance.

One of the interesting entrances is located near the bus stop
[*Pienista* - *Obywatelska*](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pienista+-+Obywatelska+%281679%29,+Łódź,+Poland/@51.7404143,19.4168521,19z).
Take the bus 65 towards the airport. Get off at *Pienista*, continue
to *Denna*. Follow the foul smell. There will be two entrances -
follow the one that smells a bit less gross - it's for rainwater, but
it will later merge with the sewers and lead you to
[Lindley's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lindley)
[chamber](http://www.zwik.lodz.pl/wgrane_pliki/big_lodz_wodociagi_2738_aokk.jpg),
situated near train station
[PKP Kaliska](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Łódź+Kaliska).

Be prepared for a rough march, it's about 2-3km and the first part of
the corridor has a pretty low ceiling. Also consider that you might
have to go back the same way - lifting the manhole lid is much more
difficult than it looks on the movies! Especially since you'll need
one hand to hold on to the ladder; especially since you can never be
certain where you'd get out and if a car won't run over you.

Beware that this is not exactly a safe sport. It's actually
**life-threateningly dangerous**, even if you're not a total moron.
Take a friend with you. Don't do it if you're not sure. Inform someone
about the trip, have them await an update. Consider that the mobile
network coverage might be very poor, or even nonexistent. Consider
bringing some eye protection - your eyes might start to hurt after an
hour or two. And **most importantly**,
[**check the weather forecast**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=weather+lodz)
and confirm that there's zero rain expected - you don't want to get
flushed!

Take a good, long shower afterwards!
