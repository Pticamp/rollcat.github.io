Updated 2019-12-22: With [dark mode
CSS](https://css-tricks.com/dark-modes-with-css/), it's now possible to match
your website's color scheme with the user's preferences. Finally!

## Original 2015-04-29

I prefer black text on white paper and light text on dark screens -
especially at night time, when any huge swath of white will just burn
my eyes!

However most system UI's default to light backgrounds, making a dark
website stand out really poorly. There's this giant stripe of whatever
bright, eye-piercing color your browser's address bar uses, right over
a dark web page, which makes the effect even worse.

Thus, `www.rollc.at` doesn't try to mess with your eyes, and uses your
default system colors (which usually means black text on white
background). However, if you took the care to switch to a dark system
theme, you can also use [Stylish](https://userstyles.org/) for
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) or
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe)
and opt-in for a
[black rolling cat](https://userstyles.org/styles/113230/rollc-at-crny-macak)!
